Uber Eats US 

This project is clone of Uber Eats US, a online food orderering and delivery platform. I have designed the frontend page of the website.




## Functionalities

In this project I have provided all the Functionalities that is available in the original website.

some of the highlighted Functionalities are:

At the top of the page by default the nav bar will be transparent but the moment we scroll the background color will change to white. The position of the nav bar is fixed. I have implimented this using JavaScript.

At thee top there is an option named Delivery address, in that case also when the user scrolls down and the moment the fixed nav bar crosses the address bar, in the nav bar the address option will apprear. By default the display property of adress bar in the nav bar is 'none'. I have implimented this using JavaScript.

I have used hover effect, at all of the Buttos.

In my page there's sidebar, which will appear after clicking the menu icon.
I have used transition to look more user friendly. When the user click's on the icon the side bar opens and to close this side bar
user have to click on the outside of the sidebar. I have diabled scroll after user opens sidebar.
